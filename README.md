Object_Tracking
===============

OpenCV Mean-Shift Algorithm Object Tracking

This is basically an object-tracking program I made over the summer using OpenCV 2. I learned computer vision tracking
through the book "OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookebook" by Robert Laganiere, and this project
is actually inspired by one of the recipes in the book, which introduced me to histograms and the mean-shift algorithm.
The book only dealt with individual images, though, so I decided to expand the object-tracking concept and apply it to
a live video from a webcam.
